## Libraries used

> ‚ñ∂Ô∏è React Navigation: For navigation purpose, because I'm build 2 screen Home and DailyForecast so need to handle navigate go and back between these 2 screens

> üï• dayJs: Due to need display date information, so dayJs is a minimalist JavaScript library for handle datetime, and also it's about 2kB JavaScript date utility library instead of using Moment

> üìö lodash: Some utility functions

> ‚ö†Ô∏è react-native-error-boundary: Because this will help catch Javascript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display fallback UI https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html

> üóΩ Recoil: A small, fast, and flexible shared state, because we need to using data from OpenWeatherMapApi, but need to display at multiple places, that's why I'm using recoil (of course we still can try passing props using react-navigation, but this might be easier and good for scale)

> üíÖüèæ styled-components: This will help style your apps without stress, instead of increase the complexity of folder and files by create more styles.css, using this can make code clean and short
